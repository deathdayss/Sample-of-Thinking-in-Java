## 9. Holding Your Object

### Generics and type-safe containers

Here, a special Java SE5 annotation is used to suppress the warning. Annotations start with an ‘@’ sign, and can take an argument; this one is **@SuppressWarnings** and the argument indicates that "unchecked" warnings only should be suppressed:

```java
class Apple {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public long id() { return id; }
}
class Orange {}
public class ApplesAndOrangesWithoutGenerics {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList apples = new ArrayList();
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
            apples.add(new Apple());
        // Not prevented from adding an Orange to apples:
        apples.add(new Orange());
        for(int i = 0; i < apples.size(); i++)
            ((Apple)apples.get(i)).id();
        // Orange is detected only at run time
    }
} /* (Execute to see output) *///:~
```

### Basic concepts

The Java container library takes the idea of "holding your objects" and divides it into two distinct concepts, expressed as the basic interfaces of the library:

1. **Collection**: a sequence of individual elements with one or more rules applied to them. A *List* must hold the elements in the way that they were inserted, a Set cannot have duplicate elements, and a **Queue** produces the elements in the order determined by a queuing discipline (usually the same order in which they are inserted).
2. **Map**: a group of key-value object pairs, allowing you to look up a value using a key. An **ArrayList** allows you to look up an object using a number, so in a sense it associates numbers to objects. A map allows you to look up an object using another object. It’s also called an **associative array**, because it associates objects with other objects, or a dictionary, because you look up a value object using a key object just like you look up a definition using a word. **Maps** are powerful programming tools.

The **Collection** interface generalizes the idea of a sequence—a way of holding a group of objects. Here’s a simple example that fills a Collection (represented here with an **ArrayList**) with **Integer** objects and then prints each element in the resulting container:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SimpleCollection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Collection<Integer> c = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            c.add(i); // Autoboxing
        for(Integer i : c)
            System.out.print(i + ", ");
    }
} /* Output:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
*///:~
```
