## 4. Access Control

<h3 id = "1"> Interface and implementation</h3>
```java
//: access/OrganizedByAccess.java
public class OrganizedByAccess {
    public void pub1() { /* ... */ }
    public void pub2() { /* ... */ }
    public void pub3() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv1() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv2() { /* ... */ }
    private void priv3() { /* ... */ }
    private int i;
// ...
} ///:~
```
This will make it only partially easier to read, because the interface and implementation are still mixed together.
<h3 id = "2">  Class access</h3>
* Make all constructors private to prevent direct creation of a class.
* Use a **static** method to return a new object in **Soup1**.
* Use a **Singleton** to allow only one object to be created  in **Soup2**.

```java
//: access/Lunch.java
// Demonstrates class access specifiers. Make a class
// effectively private with private constructors:
class Soup1 {
    private Soup1() {}
    // (1) Allow creation via static method:
    public static Soup1 makeSoup() {
        return new Soup1();
    }
}
class Soup2 {
    private Soup2() {}
    // (2) Create a static object and return a reference
// upon request.(The "Singleton" pattern):
    private static Soup2 ps1 = new Soup2();
    public static Soup2 access() {
        return ps1;
    }
    public void f() {}
}
// Only one public class allowed per file:
public class Lunch {
    void testPrivate() {
// Can’t do this! Private constructor:
//! Soup1 soup = new Soup1();
    }
    void testStatic() {
        Soup1 soup = Soup1.makeSoup();
    }
    void testSingleton() {
        Soup2.access().f();
    }
} ///:~
```

<h3 id = "3"> Summary </h3>
There are two reasons for controlling access to members. The first is to keep users’ hands off portions that they shouldn’t touch. So making methods and fields **private** is a service to client programmers, because they can easily see what’s important to them and what they can ignore.

The second and most important reason for access control is to allow the library designer to change the internal workings of the class without worrying about how it will affect the client programmer.
