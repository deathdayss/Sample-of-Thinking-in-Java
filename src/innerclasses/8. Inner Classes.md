## 8. Inner Classes
### Inner classes in methods and scopes
The inner class can be used:
1. A class defined within a method
2. A class defined within a scope inside a method
3. An anonymous class implementing an interface
4. An anonymous class extending a class that has a non-default constructor
5. An anonymous class that performs field initialization
6. An anonymous class that performs construction using instance
### Anonymous inner classes
```java
public class Parcel7 {
    public Contents contents() {
        return new Contents() { // Insert a class definition
            private int i = 11;
            public int value() { return i; }
        }; // Semicolon required in this case
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel7 p = new Parcel7();
        Contents c = p.contents();
    }
} ///:~
```
The contents( ) method combines the creation of the return value with the definition of the class that represents that return value! In addition, the class is anonymous; it has no name.
```java
public class Parcel8 {
    public Wrapping wrapping(int x) {
// Base constructor call:
        return new Wrapping(x) { // Pass constructor argument.
            public int value() {
                return super.value() * 47;
            }
        }; // Semicolon required
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel8 p = new Parcel8();
        Wrapping w = p.wrapping(10);
    }
} ///:~
```
That is, you simply pass the appropriate argument to the base-class constructor, seen here as the x passed in new Wrapping(x). Although it’s an ordinary class with an implementation, Wrapping is also being used as a common "interface" to its derived classes:
```java
public class Wrapping {
    private int i;
    public Wrapping(int x) { i = x; }
    public int value() { return i; }
} ///:~
```
You can also perform initialization when you define fields in an anonymous class:
```java
// initialization. A briefer version of Parcel5.java.
public class Parcel9 {
    // Argument must be final to use inside
    // anonymous inner class:
    // don't need the final after java 8 (it is implicit final)
    public Destination destination(final String dest) {
        return new Destination() {
            private String label = dest;
            public String readLabel() { return label; }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel9 p = new Parcel9();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania");
    }
} ///:~
```
If you’re defining an anonymous inner class and want to use an object that’s defined outside the anonymous inner class, the compiler requires that the argument reference be`final` as you see in the argument to `destination( )` If you forget, you’ll get a compile-time error message.
We don't need the final after java 8.
### Why inner classes?
So the most compelling reason for inner classes is:
Each inner class can independently inherit from an implementation. Thus, the inner class is not limited by whether the outer class is already inheriting from an implementation.
To see this in more detail, consider a situation in which you have two interfaces that must somehow be implemented within a class. Because of the flexibility of interfaces, you have two choices: a single class or an inner class.
```java
interface A {}
interface B {}
class X implements A, B {}
class Y implements A {
    B makeB() {
// Anonymous inner class:
        return new B() {};
    }
}
public class MultiInterfaces {
    static void takesA(A a) {}
    static void takesB(B b) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        X x = new X();
        Y y = new Y();
        takesA(x);
        takesA(y);
        takesB(x);
        takesB(y.makeB());
    }
} ///:~
```
However, if you have abstract or concrete classes instead of interfaces, you are suddenly limited to using inner classes if your class must somehow implement both of the others:
```java
class D {}
abstract class E {}
class Z extends D {
    E makeE() { return new E() {}; }
}
public class MultiImplementation {
    static void takesD(D d) {}
    static void takesE(E e) {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Z z = new Z();
        takesD(z);
        takesE(z.makeE());
    }
} ///:~
```
with inner classes you have these additional features:
1. The inner class can have multiple instances, each with its own state information that is independent of the information in the outer-class object.
2. In a single outer class you can have several inner classes, each of which implements the same interface or inherits from the same class in a different way. An example of this will be shown shortly.
3. The point of creation of the inner-class object is not tied to the creation of the outer-class object.
4. There is no potentially confusing "is-a" relationship with the inner class; it’s a separate entity.
### Closures & callbacks
A closure is a callable object that retains information from the scope in which it was created. From this definition, you can see that an inner class is an object-oriented closure, because it doesn’t just contain each piece of information from the outer-class object ("the scope in which it was created"), but it automatically holds a reference back to the whole outer-class object, where it has permission to manipulate all the members, even `private` ones.
One of the most compelling arguments made to include some kind of pointer mechanism in Java was to allow callbacks. With a callback, some other object is given a piece of information that allows it to call back into the originating object at some later point. This is a very powerful concept, as you will see later in the book. 
```java
interface Incrementable {
    void increment();
}
// Very simple to just implement the interface:
class Callee1 implements Incrementable {
    private int i = 0;
    public void increment() {
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
class MyIncrement {
    public void increment() { System.out.println("Other operation"); }
    static void f(MyIncrement mi) { mi.increment(); }
}
// If your class must implement increment() in
// some other way, you must use an inner class:
class Callee2 extends MyIncrement {
    private int i = 0;
    public void increment() {
        super.increment();
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);
    }
    private class Closure implements Incrementable {
        public void increment() {
// Specify outer-class method, otherwise
// you’d get an infinite recursion:
            Callee2.this.increment();
        }
    }
    Incrementable getCallbackReference() {
        return new Closure();
    }
}
class Caller {
    private Incrementable callbackReference;
    Caller(Incrementable cbh) { callbackReference = cbh; }
    void go() { callbackReference.increment(); }
}
public class Callbacks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Callee1 c1 = new Callee1();
        Callee2 c2 = new Callee2();
        MyIncrement.f(c2);
        Caller caller1 = new Caller(c1);
        Caller caller2 = new Caller(c2.getCallbackReference());
        caller1.go();
        caller1.go();
        caller2.go();
        caller2.go();
    }
} /* Output:
Other operation
1
1
2
Other operation
2
Other operation
3
*///:~
```
The inner class `Closure` implements Incrementable to provide a hook back into `Callee2`but a safe hook. Whoever gets the `Incrementable` reference can, of course, only call `increment( )` and has no other abilities (unlike a pointer, which would allow you to run wild).
`Caller` takes an `Incrementable` reference in its constructor (although the capturing of the callback reference could happen at any time) and then, sometime later, uses the reference to "call back" into the `Callee` class
### Inner classes & control frameworks
An *application framework* is a class or a set of classes that’s designed to solve a particular
type of problem. To apply an application framework, you typically inherit from one or more
classes and override some of the methods. The code that you write in the overridden methods
customizes the general solution provided by that application framework in order to solve
your specific problem. This is an example of the *Template Method* design pattern. The Template Method contains the basic structure of the algorithm, and it calls one or more overrideable methods to complete the action of that algorithm. A design pattern separates things that change from things that stay the same, and in this case the Template Method is the part that stays the same, and the overrideable methods are the things that change.
A control framework is a particular type of application framework dominated by the need to respond to events. A system that primarily responds to events is called an event-driven system.
To see how inner classes allow the simple creation and use of control frameworks, consider a control framework whose job is to execute events whenever those events are "ready." Although "ready" could mean anything, in this case it will be based on clock time. What follows is a control framework that contains no specific information about what it’s controlling. That information is supplied during inheritance, when the `action( )` portion of the algorithm is implemented.
```java
public abstract class Event {
    private long eventTime;
    protected final long delayTime;
    public Event(long delayTime) {
        this.delayTime = delayTime;
        start();
    }
    public void start() { // Allows restarting
        eventTime = System.nanoTime() + delayTime;
    }
    public boolean ready() {
        return System.nanoTime() >= eventTime;
    }
    public abstract void action();
} ///:~
```
The constructor captures the time (measured from the time of creation of the object) when you want the `Event` to run, and then calls `start( )`, which takes the current time and adds the delay time to produce the time when the event will occur. Rather than being included in the constructor, `start( )` is a separate method. This way, you can restart the timer after the event has run out, so the `Event` object can be reused. For example, if you want a repeating event, you can simply call `start( )` inside your `action( )` method.
`ready( )` tells you when it’s time to run the `action( )` method. Of course, `ready( )` can be overridden in a derived class to base the `Event` on something other than time.
The following file contains the actual control framework that manages and fires events. The `Event` objects are held inside a container object of type `List<Event>` (pronounced "List of Event"), which you’ll learn more about in the Holding Your Objects chapter. For now, all you need to know is that `add( )` will append an `Event` to the end of the `List`, `size( )` produces the number of entries in the `List`, the foreach syntax fetches successive `Events` from the `List`, and `remove( )` removes the specified Event from the List.
```java
public class Controller {
    // A class from java.util to hold Event objects:
    private List<Event> eventList = new ArrayList<Event>();
    public void addEvent(Event c) { eventList.add(c); }
    public void run() {
        while(eventList.size() > 0)
// Make a copy so you’re not modifying the list
// while you’re selecting the elements in it:
            for(Event e : new ArrayList<Event>(eventList))
                if(e.ready()) {
                    System.out.println(e);
                    e.action();
                    eventList.remove(e);
                }
    }
} ///:~
```
Note that so far in this design you know nothing about exactly what an `Event` does. And this is the crux of the design—how it "separates the things that change from the things that stay the same." Or, to use my term, the "vector of change" is the different actions of the various kinds of `Event` objects, and you express different actions by creating different `Event` subclasses

This is where inner classes come into play. They allow two things:

1. The entire implementation of a control framework is created in a single class, thereby encapsulating everything that’s unique about that implementation. Inner classes are used to express the many different kinds of action( ) necessary to solve the problem.
2. Inner classes keep this implementation from becoming awkward, since you’re able to easily access any of the members in the outer class. Without this ability the code might become unpleasant enough that you’d end up seeking an alternative.

Inner classes allow you to have multiple derived versions of the same base class, `Event`, within a single class. For each type of action, you inherit a new `Event` inner class, and write the control code in the `action( )` implementation.

As is typical with an application framework, the class `GreenhouseControls` is inherited from `Controller`:
```java
public class GreenhouseControls extends Controller {
    private boolean light = false;
    public class LightOn extends Event {
        public LightOn(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here to
        // physically turn on the light.
            light = true;
        }
        public String toString() { return "Light is on"; }
    }
    public class LightOff extends Event {
        public LightOff(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here to
        // physically turn off the light.
            light = false;
        }
        public String toString() { return "Light is off"; }
    }
    private boolean water = false;
    public class WaterOn extends Event {
        public WaterOn(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here.
            water = true;
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Greenhouse water is on";
        }
    }
    public class WaterOff extends Event {
        public WaterOff(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here.
            water = false;
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Greenhouse water is off";
        }
    }
    private String thermostat = "Day";
    public class ThermostatNight extends Event {
        public ThermostatNight(long delayTime) {
            super(delayTime);
        }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here.
            thermostat = "Night";
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Thermostat on night setting";
        }
    }
    public class ThermostatDay extends Event {
        public ThermostatDay(long delayTime) {
            super(delayTime);
        }
        public void action() {
        // Put hardware control code here.
            thermostat = "Day";
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Thermostat on day setting";
        }
    }
        // An example of an action() that inserts a
        // new one of itself into the event list:
    public class Bell extends Event {
        public Bell(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() {
            addEvent(new Bell(delayTime));
        }
        public String toString() { return "Bing!"; }
    }
    public class Restart extends Event {
        private Event[] eventList;
        public Restart(long delayTime, Event[] eventList) {
            super(delayTime);
            this.eventList = eventList;
            for(Event e : eventList)
                addEvent(e);
        }
        public void action() {
            for(Event e : eventList) {
                e.start(); // Rerun each event
                addEvent(e);
            }
            start(); // Rerun this Event
            addEvent(this);
        }
        public String toString() {
            return "Restarting system";
        }
    }
    public static class Terminate extends Event {
        public Terminate(long delayTime) { super(delayTime); }
        public void action() { System.exit(0); }
        public String toString() { return "Terminating"; }
    }
} ///:~
```
Most of the `Event` classes look similar, but `Bell` and `Restart` are special. `Bell` rings and then adds a new `Bell` object to the event list, so it will ring again later. Notice how inner classes almost look like multiple inheritance: `Bell` and `Restart` have all the methods of Event and also appear to have all the methods of the outer class `GreenhouseControls`.
`Restart` is given an array of `Event` objects that it adds to the controller. Since `Restart( )` is just another `Event` object, you can also add a `Restart` object within `Restart.action( )` so that the system regularly restarts itself.

The following class configures the system by creating a `GreenhouseControls` object and adding various kinds of `Event` objects. This is an example of the *Command* design pattern—each object in `eventList` is a request encapsulated as an object:
```java
import innerclasses.controller.*;
public class GreenhouseController {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreenhouseControls gc = new GreenhouseControls();
// Instead of hard-wiring, you could parse
// configuration information from a text file here:
        gc.addEvent(gc.new Bell(900));
        Event[] eventList = {
                gc.new ThermostatNight(0),
                gc.new LightOn(200),
                gc.new LightOff(400),
                gc.new WaterOn(600),
                gc.new WaterOff(800),
                gc.new ThermostatDay(1400)
        };
        gc.addEvent(gc.new Restart(2000, eventList));
        if(args.length == 1)
            gc.addEvent(
                    new GreenhouseControls.Terminate(
                            new Integer(args[0])));
        gc.run();
    }
} /* Output:
Bing!
Thermostat on night setting
Light is on
Light is off
Greenhouse water is on
Greenhouse water is off
Thermostat on day setting
Restarting system
Terminating
*///:~
```
This class initializes the system, so it adds all the appropriate events. The `Restart` event is repeatedly run, and it loads the `eventList` into the `GreenhouseControls` object each time. If you provide a command-line argument indicating milliseconds, it will terminate the program after that many milliseconds (this is used for testing).
### Inheriting from inner classes
The problem is that the "secret" reference to the enclosing class object must be initialized, and yet in the derived class there’s no longer a default object to attach to. You must use a special syntax to make the association explicit:
```java
class WithInner {
    class Inner {}
}
public class InheritInner extends WithInner.Inner {
    //! InheritInner() {} // Won’t compile
    InheritInner(WithInner wi) {
        wi.super();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WithInner wi = new WithInner();
        InheritInner ii = new InheritInner(wi);
    }
} ///:~
```
### Can inner classes be overridden?
```java
class Egg {
    private Yolk y;
    protected class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { System.out.println("Egg.Yolk()"); }
    }
    public Egg() {
        System.out.println("New Egg()");
        y = new Yolk();
    }
}
public class BigEgg extends Egg {
    public class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { System.out.println("BigEgg.Yolk()"); }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new BigEgg();
    }
} /* Output:
New Egg()
Egg.Yolk()
*///:~
```
The default constructor is synthesized automatically by the compiler, and this calls the base-class default constructor. You might think that since a `BigEgg` is being created, the "overridden" version of `Yolk` would be used, but this is not the case, as you can see from the output.
This example shows that there isn’t any extra inner-class magic going on when you inherit from the outer class. The two inner classes are completely separate entities, each in its own namespace. However, it’s still possible to explicitly inherit from the inner class:
```java
class Egg2 {
    protected class Yolk {
        public Yolk() { System.out.println("Egg2.Yolk()"); }
        public void f() { System.out.println("Egg2.Yolk.f()");}
    }
    private Yolk y = new Yolk();
    public Egg2() { System.out.println("New Egg2()"); }
    public void insertYolk(Yolk yy) { y = yy; }
    public void g() { y.f(); }
}
public class BigEgg2 extends Egg2 {
    public class Yolk extends Egg2.Yolk {
        public Yolk() { System.out.println("BigEgg2.Yolk()"); }
        public void f() { System.out.println("BigEgg2.Yolk.f()"); }
    }
    public BigEgg2() { insertYolk(new Yolk()); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Egg2 e2 = new BigEgg2();
        e2.g();
    }
} /* Output:
Egg2.Yolk()
New Egg2()
Egg2.Yolk()
BigEgg2.Yolk()
BigEgg2.Yolk.f()
*///:~
```
Now BigEgg2.Yolk explicitly `extends Egg2`.Yolk and overrides its methods. The method `insertYolk( )` allows `BigEgg2` to upcast one of its own `Yolk` objects into the y reference in `Egg2`, so when `g( )` calls `y.f( )`, the overridden version of `f( )` is used. The second call to `Egg2.Yolk( )` is the base-class constructor call of the `BigEgg2.Yolk` constructor. You can see that the overridden version of `f( )` is used when `g( )` is called.

### Local inner classes

A local inner class cannot have an access specifier because it isn’t part of the outer class, but it does have access to the final variables in the current code block and all the members of the enclosing class.

```java
interface Counter {
    int next();
}
public class LocalInnerClass {
    private int count = 0;
    Counter getCounter(final String name) {
// A local inner class:
        class LocalCounter implements Counter {
            public LocalCounter() {
// Local inner class can have a constructor
                System.out.println("LocalCounter()");
            }
            public int next() {
                System.out.println(name); // Access local final
                return count++;
            }
        }
        return new LocalCounter();
    }
    // The same thing with an anonymous inner class:
    Counter getCounter2(final String name) {
        return new Counter() {
            // Anonymous inner class cannot have a named
// constructor, only an instance initializer:
            {
                System.out.println("Counter()");
            }
            public int next() {
                System.out.println(name); // Access local final
                return count++;
            }
        };
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalInnerClass lic = new LocalInnerClass();
        Counter
                c1 = lic.getCounter("Local inner "),
                c2 = lic.getCounter2("Anonymous inner ");
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            System.out.println(c1.next());
        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            System.out.println(c2.next());
    }
} /* Output:
LocalCounter()
Counter()
Local inner 0
Local inner 1
Local inner 2
Local inner 3
Local inner 4
Anonymous inner 5
Anonymous inner 6
Anonymous inner 7
Anonymous inner 8
Anonymous inner 9
*///:~
```

Since the name of the local inner class is not accessible outside the method, the only justification for using a local inner class instead of an anonymous inner class is if you need a named constructor and/or an overloaded constructor, since an anonymous inner class can only use instance initialization.
Another reason to make a local inner class rather than an anonymous inner class is if you need to make more than one object of that class.

### Inner-class identifiers

The names of these files/classes have a strict formula: the name of the
enclosing class, followed by a ‘$’, followed by the name of the inner class. For example, the .class files created by LocalInnerClass.java include:

> Counter.class
> LocalInnerClass$l.class
> LocallnnerClassSlLocalCounter.class
> LocallnnerClass.class

If inner classes are anonymous, the compiler simply starts generating numbers as inner-class identifiers. If inner classes are nested within inner classes, their names are simply appended after a ‘$’ and the outer-class identifier (s).
