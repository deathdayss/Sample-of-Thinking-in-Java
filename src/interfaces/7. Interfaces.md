```java

    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    Object process(Object input) { return input; }
}

class Upcase extends Processor {
    String process(Object input) { // Covariant return
        return ((String)input).toUpperCase();
    }
}

class Downcase extends Processor {
    String process(Object input) {
        return ((String)input).toLowerCase();
    }
}

    String process(Object input) {
// The split() argument divides a String into pieces:
        return Arrays.toString(((String)input).split(" "));
    }
}
public class Apply {
    public static void process(Processor p, Object s) {
        System.out.println("Using Processor " + p.name());
        System.out.println(p.process(s));
    }
    public static String s =
            "Disagreement with beliefs is by definition incorrect";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        process(new Upcase(), s);
        process(new Downcase(), s);
        process(new Splitter(), s);
    }
} /* Output:

```
The `Apply.process( )` method takes any kind of `Processor` and applies it to an Object, then prints the results. Creating a method that behaves differently depending on the argument object that you pass it is called the Strategy design pattern.
Now suppose you discover a set of electronic filters that seem like they could fit into your `Apply.process( )` method:

```java
package interfaces.classprocessor;

public class Waveform {
    private static long counter;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public String toString() { return "Waveform " + id; }
} ///:~

public class Filter {
    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~

public class LowPass extends Filter {
    double cutoff;
    public LowPass(double cutoff) { this.cutoff = cutoff; }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) {
        return input; // Dummy processing
    }
} ///:~

public class HighPass extends Filter {
    double cutoff;
    public HighPass(double cutoff) { this.cutoff = cutoff; }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~

public class BandPass extends Filter {
    double lowCutoff, highCutoff;
    public BandPass(double lowCut, double highCut) {
        lowCutoff = lowCut;
        highCutoff = highCut;
    }
    public Waveform process(Waveform input) { return input; }
} ///:~
```
Filter has the same interface elements as `Processor`, but because it isn’t inherited from `Processor`—because the creator of the `Filter` class had no clue you might want to use it as a `Processor`—you can’t use a `Filter` with the `Apply.process( )` method, even though it would work fine.
If `Processor` is an interface, however, the constraints are loosened enough that you can reuse an `Apply.process( )` that takes that interface. Here are the modified versions of `Processor` and `Apply`:

```java
package interfaces.interfaceprocessor;

public interface Processor {
    String name();
    Object process(Object input);
} ///:~

public class Apply {
    public static void process(Processor p, Object s) {
        System.out.println("Using Processor " + p.name());
        System.out.println(p.process(s));
    }
} ///:~

public abstract class StringProcessor implements Processor{
    public String name() {
        return getClass().getSimpleName();
    }
    public abstract String process(Object input);
    public static String s =
            "If she weighs the same as a duck, she’s made of wood";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Apply.process(new Upcase(), s);
        Apply.process(new Downcase(), s);
        Apply.process(new Splitter(), s);
    }
}

class Upcase extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) { // Covariant return
        return ((String)input).toUpperCase();
    }
}

class Downcase extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) {
        return ((String)input).toLowerCase();
    }
}

class Splitter extends StringProcessor {
    public String process(Object input) {
        return Arrays.toString(((String)input).split(" "));
    }
} /* Output:
Using Processor Upcase
IF SHE WEIGHS THE SAME AS A DUCK, SHE’S MADE OF WOOD

```
However, you are often in the situation of not being able to modify the classes that you want to use. In these cases, you can use the Adapter design pattern. In Adapter, you write code to take the interface that you have and produce the interface that you need, like this:
```java
import interfaces.filters.*;
class FilterAdapter implements Processor {
    Filter filter;
    public FilterAdapter(Filter filter) {
        this.filter = filter;
    }
    public String name() { return filter.name(); }
    public Waveform process(Object input) {
        return filter.process((Waveform)input);
    }
}
public class FilterProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Waveform w = new Waveform();
        Apply.process(new FilterAdapter(new LowPass(1.0)), w);
        Apply.process(new FilterAdapter(new HighPass(2.0)), w);
        Apply.process(
                new FilterAdapter(new BandPass(3.0, 4.0)), w);
    }
} /* Output:
Using Processor LowPass
Waveform 0
Using Processor HighPass
Waveform 0
Using Processor BandPass
Waveform 0
*///:~
```
In this approach to Adapter, the `FilterAdapter` constructor takes the interface that you have—`Filter`—and produces an object that has the `Processor` interface that you need. You may also notice delegation in the `FilterAdapter` class.

<h3 id = "4"> “Multiple inheritance” in Java</h3>
When you combine a concrete class with interfaces this way, the concrete class must come first, then the interfaces. (The compiler gives an error otherwise.)

Core reasons for interfaces:
1. Upcast to more than one base type (and the flexibility that this provides).
2. The same as using an abstract base class: to prevent the client programmer from making an object of this class and to establish that it is only an interface.

This brings up a question: Should you use an interface or an abstract class? If it’s possible to create your base class without any method definitions or member variables, you should always prefer interfaces to abstract classes. In fact, if you know something is going to be a base class, you can consider making it an interface

<h3 id = "5"> Name collisions when combining Interfaces</h3>
```java
interface I1 { void f(); }
interface I2 { int f(int i); }
interface I3 { int f(); }
class C { public int f() { return 1; } }
class C2 implements I1, I2 {
    public void f() {}
    public int f(int i) { return 1; } // overloaded
}
class C3 extends C implements I2 {
    public int f(int i) { return 1; } // overloaded
}
public class C4 extends C implements I3 {
    // Identical, no problem:
    public int f() { return 1; }
}
// Methods differ only by return type:
//! class C5 extends C implements I1 {}
//! interface I4 extends I1, I3 {} ///:~
```
The difficulty occurs because overriding, implementation, and overloading get unpleasantly mixed together. Also, overloaded methods cannot differ only by return type.
Using the same method names in different interfaces that are intended to be combined generally causes confusion in the readability of the code, as well. Strive to avoid it.
<h3 id = "6"> Adapting to an interface</h3>
Thus, a common use for interfaces is the aforementioned Strategy design pattern. You write
a method that performs certain operations, and that method takes an interface that you also
specify. You’re basically saying, "You can use my method with any object you like, as long as
your object conforms to my interface." This makes your method more flexible, general and
reusable.
```java
//: interfaces/RandomWords.java
// Implementing an interface to conform to a method.
import java.nio.*;
import java.util.*;
public class RandomWords implements Readable {
    private static Random rand = new Random(47);
    private static final char[] capitals =
            "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".toCharArray();
    private static final char[] lowers =
            "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".toCharArray();
    private static final char[] vowels =
            "aeiou".toCharArray();
    private int count;
    public RandomWords(int count) { this.count = count; }
    public int read(CharBuffer cb) {
        if(count-- == 0)
            return -1; // Indicates end of input
        cb.append(capitals[rand.nextInt(capitals.length)]);
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            cb.append(vowels[rand.nextInt(vowels.length)]);
            cb.append(lowers[rand.nextInt(lowers.length)]);
        }
        cb.append(" ");
        return 10; // Number of characters appended
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(new RandomWords(10));
        while(s.hasNext())
            System.out.println(s.next());
    }

<h3 id = "7"> Nesting interfaces</h3>
```java

        void f();
    }
    public class BImp implements B {
        public void f() {}
    }

    public D getD() { return new DImp2(); }
    private D dRef;
    public void receiveD(D d) {
        dRef = d;
        dRef.f();
    }
}
interface E {

    class EImp2 implements E {
        public void g() {}
        class EG implements E.G {

        }
    }

// Cannot access a member of the interface:
//! a.getD().f();
// Only another A can do anything with getD():
        A a2 = new A();
        a2.receiveD(a.getD());
    }
} ///:~
```
As an added twist, interfaces can also be `private`, as seen in `A.D` (the same qualification syntax is used for nested interfaces as for nested classes). What good is a `private` nested interface? You might guess that it can only be implemented as a `private` inner class as in `DImp`, but `A.DImp2` shows that it can also be implemented as a `public` class. However, `A.DImp2` can only be used as itself. You are not allowed to mention the fact that it implements the `private` interface D, so implementing a `private` interface is a way to force the definition of the methods in that interface without adding any type information (that is, without allowing any upcasting).
The method `getD( )` produces a further quandary concerning the `private` interface: It’s a `public` method that returns a reference to a `private` interface. What can you do with the return value of this method? In `main( )`, you can see several attempts to use the return value, all of which fail. The only thing that works is if the return value is handed to an object that has permission to use it—in this case, another `A`, via the `receiveD( )` method.
Interface `E` shows that an interface nested within another interface is automatically `public` and cannot be made `private`.
`Nestinglnterfaces` shows the various ways that nested interfaces can be implemented. In particular, notice that when you implement an interface, you are not required to implement any interfaces nested within. Also, `private` interfaces cannot be implemented outside of their defining classes.
<h3 id = "8"> Interfaces and factories</h3>
An interface is intended to be a gateway to multiple implementations, and a typical way to produce objects that fit the interface is the Factory Method design pattern. Instead of calling a constructor directly, you call a creation method on a factory object which produces an implementation of the interface—this way, in theory, your code is completely isolated from the implementation of the interface, thus making it possible to transparently swap one implementation for another. Here’s a demonstration showing the structure of the Factory Method:
```java
interface Service {
    void method1();
    void method2();
}
interface ServiceFactory {
    Service getService();
}
class Implementation1 implements Service {
    Implementation1() {} // Package access
    public void method1() {System.out.println("Implementation1 method1");}
    public void method2() {System.out.println("Implementation1 method2");}
}
class Implementation1Factory implements ServiceFactory {
    public Service getService() {
        return new Implementation1();
    }
}
class Implementation2 implements Service {
    Implementation2() {} // Package access
    public void method1() {System.out.println("Implementation2 method1");}
    public void method2() {System.out.println("Implementation2 method2");}
}
class Implementation2Factory implements ServiceFactory {
    public Service getService() {
        return new Implementation2();
    }
}
public class Factories {
    public static void serviceConsumer(ServiceFactory fact) {
        Service s = fact.getService();
        s.method1();
        s.method2();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        serviceConsumer(new Implementation1Factory());
// Implementations are completely interchangeable:
        serviceConsumer(new Implementation2Factory());
    }
} /* Output:
Implementation1 method1
Implementation1 method2
Implementation2 method1
Implementation2
```
Without the Factory Method, your code would somewhere have to specify the exact type of Service being created, so that it could call the appropriate constructor.
<h3 id = "9"> Using .this and .new</h3>
If you need to produce the reference to the outer-class object, you name the outer class followed by a dot and `this`.
```java
// Qualifying access to the outer-class object.
public class DotThis {
    void f() { System.out.println("DotThis.f()"); }
    public class Inner {
        public DotThis outer() {
            return DotThis.this;
// A plain "this" would be Inner’s "this"
        }
    }
    public Inner inner() { return new Inner(); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DotThis dt = new DotThis();
        DotThis.Inner dti = dt.inner();
        dti.outer().f();
    }
} /* Output:
DotThis.f()
*///:~
```
Sometimes you want to tell some other object to create an object of one of its inner classes. To do this you must provide a reference to the other outer-class object in the new expression, using the `.new` syntax, like this:
```java
public class DotNew {
    public class Inner {}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DotNew dn = new DotNew();
        DotNew.Inner dni = dn.new Inner();
    }
} ///:~
```
<h3 id = "10"> Inner classes and upcasting</h3>
When you get a reference to the base class or the interface, it’s possible that you can’t even find out the exact type, as shown here:
```java
class Parcel4 {
    private class PContents implements Contents {
        private int i = 11;
        public int value() { return i; }
    }
    protected class PDestination implements Destination {
        private String label;
        private PDestination(String whereTo) {
            label = whereTo;
        }
        public String readLabel() { return label; }
    }
    public Destination destination(String s) {
        return new PDestination(s);
    }
    public Contents contents() {
        return new PContents();
    }
}
public class TestParcel {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parcel4 p = new Parcel4();
        Contents c = p.contents();
        Destination d = p.destination("Tasmania");
// Illegal -- can’t access private class:
//! Parcel4.PContents pc = p.new PContents();
    }
} ///:~
```
In fact, you can’t even downcast to a `private` inner class (or a `protected` inner class unless you’re an inheritor), because you can’t access the name, as you can see in` class TestParcel`. Thus, the `private` inner class provides a way for the class designer to completely prevent any type-coding dependencies and to completely hide details about implementation. In addition, extension of an interface is useless from the client programmer’s perspective since the client programmer cannot access any additional methods that aren’t part of the `public` interface. This also provides an opportunity for the Java compiler to generate more efficient code.
