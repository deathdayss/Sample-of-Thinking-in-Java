<h3 id = "1"> Pitfall: fields and static methods</h3>
Field accesses and static methods  are not polymorphism. Different types of references use the field and the static methods of the type.
```java
//: polymorphism/FieldAccess.java
// Direct field access is determined at compile time.
class Super {
    public int field = 0;
    public int getField() { return field; }
}
class Sub extends Super {
    public int field = 1;
    public int getField() { return field; }
    public int getSuperField() { return super.field; }
}
public class FieldAccess {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Super sup = new Sub(); // Upcast
        System.out.println("sup.field = " + sup.field +
                ", sup.getField() = " + sup.getField());
        Sub sub = new Sub();
        System.out.println("sub.field = " +
                sub.field + ", sub.getField() = " +
                sub.getField() +
                ", sub.getSuperField() = " +
                sub.getSuperField());
    }
} /* Output:
sup.field = 0, sup.getField() = 1
sub.field = 1, sub.getField() = 1, sub.getSuperField() = 0
*///:~
```
```java
//: polymorphism/StaticPolymorphism.java
// Static methods are not polymorphic.
class StaticSuper {
    public static String staticGet() {
        return "Base staticGet()";
    }
    public String dynamicGet() {
        return "Base dynamicGet()";
    }
}
class StaticSub extends StaticSuper {
    public static String staticGet() {
        return "Derived staticGet()";
    }
    public String dynamicGet() {
        return "Derived dynamicGet()";
    }
}
public class StaticPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticSuper sup = new StaticSub(); // Upcast
        System.out.println(sup.staticGet());
        System.out.println(sup.dynamicGet());
    }
} /* Output:
Base staticGet()
Derived dynamicGet()
*///:~	
```
<h3 id = "2"> Inheritance and cleanup</h3>
When cleaning up in inheritance, each layer of the class should dispose its own field and call its super's dispose. The order of disposal should be the reverse of the order of initialization, in case one subobject is dependent on another. Perform the derived-class cleanup first, then the base-class cleanup.
Use reference counting to tell if a reference of a field should be cleaned.

```java
//: polymorphism/ReferenceCounting.java
// Cleaning up shared member objects.
class Shared {
    private int refcount = 0;
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public Shared() {
        System.out.println("Creating " + this);
    }
    public void addRef() { refcount++; }
    protected void dispose() {
        if(--refcount == 0)
            System.out.println("Disposing " + this);
    }
    public String toString() { return "Shared " + id; }
}
class Composing {
    private Shared shared;
    private static long counter = 0;
    private final long id = counter++;
    public Composing(Shared shared) {
        System.out.println("Creating " + this);
        this.shared = shared;
        this.shared.addRef();
    }
    protected void dispose() {
        System.out.println("disposing " + this);
        shared.dispose();
    }
    public String toString() { return "Composing " + id; }
}
public class ReferenceCounting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shared shared = new Shared();
        Composing[] composing = { new Composing(shared),
                new Composing(shared), new Composing(shared),
                new Composing(shared), new Composing(shared) };
        for(Composing c : composing)
            c.dispose();
    }
} /* Output:
Creating Shared 0
Creating Composing 0
Creating Composing 1
Creating Composing 2
Creating Composing 3
Creating Composing 4
disposing Composing 0
disposing Composing 1

The type of counter is long rather than int, to prevent overflow (this is just good practice; overflowing such a counter is not likely to happen in any of the examples in this book). The id is final because we do not expect it to change its value during the lifetime of the object.
<h3 id = "3"> Behavior of polymorphic methods inside constructors</h3>
Inside an ordinary method, the dynamically-bound call is resolved at run time, because the object cannot know whether it belongs to the class that the method is in or some class derived from it.
If you call a dynamically-bound method inside a constructor, the overridden definition for that method is used. You call a method that might manipulate members that haven’t been initialized yet—a sure recipe for disaster.

```java
//: polymorphism/PolyConstructors.java
// Constructors and polymorphism
// don’t produce what you might expect.
class Glyph {
    void draw() { System.out.println("Glyph.draw()"); }
    Glyph() {
        System.out.println("Glyph() before draw()");
        draw();
        System.out.println("Glyph() after draw()");
    }
}
class RoundGlyph extends Glyph {
    private int radius = 1;
    RoundGlyph(int r) {
        radius = r;
        System.out.println("RoundGlyph.RoundGlyph(), radius = " + radius);
    }
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("RoundGlyph.draw(), radius = " + radius);
    }
}
public class PolyConstructors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new RoundGlyph(5);
    }
} /* Output:
Glyph() before draw()
RoundGlyph.draw(), radius = 0
Glyph() after draw()
RoundGlyph.RoundGlyph(), radius = 5
*///:~
```
1. The storage allocated for the object is initialized to binary zero before anything else happens.
2. The base-class constructors are called as described previously. At this point, the overridden draw( ) method is called (yes, before the RoundGlyph constructor is called), which discovers a radius value of zero, due to Step 1.
3. Member initializers are called in the order of declaration.
4. The body of the derived-class constructor is called.

As a result, a good guideline for constructors is, “Do as little as possible to set the object into a good state, and if you can possibly avoid it, don’t call any other methods in this class.” The only safe methods to call inside a constructor are those that are final in the base class. (This also applies to private methods, which are automatically final.)
