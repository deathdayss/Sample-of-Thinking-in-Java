## 5. Reusing Classes
### Composition syntax
Simply place object references inside new classes. If you want the references initialized, you can do it:

1. At the point the objects are defined. This means that they’ll always be initialized before the constructor is called.
2. In the constructor for that class.
3. Right before you actually need to use the object. This is often called **lazy initialization**. It can reduce overhead in situations where object creation is expensive and the object doesn’t need to be created every time.
4. Using instance initialization. 

All four approaches are shown here:
```java
class Soap {
    private String s;
    Soap() {
        System.out.println("Soap()");
        s = "Constructed";
    }
    public String toString() { return s; }
}
public class Bath {
    private String // Initializing at point of definition:
            s1 = "Happy",
            s2 = "Happy",
            s3, s4;
    private Soap castille;
    private int i;
    private float toy;
    public Bath() {
        System.out.println("Inside Bath()");
        s3 = "Joy";
        toy = 3.14f;
        castille = new Soap();
    }
    // Instance initialization:
    { i = 47; }
    public String toString() {
        if(s4 == null) // Delayed initialization:
            s4 = "Joy";
        return
                "s1 = " + s1 + "\n" +
                        "s2 = " + s2 + "\n" +
                        "s3 = " + s3 + "\n" +
                        "s4 = " + s4 + "\n" +
                        "i = " + i + "\n" +
                        "toy = " + toy + "\n" +
                        "castille = " + castille;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bath b = new Bath();
        System.out.println(b);
    }
} /* Output:
Inside Bath()
Soap()
s1 = Happy
s2 = Happy
s3 = Joy
s4 = Joy
i = 47
toy = 3.14
castille*/
```
### Initializing the base class
Java automatically inserts calls to the base-class constructor in the derived-class constructor. The following example shows this working with three levels of inheritance:
```java
class Art {
    int k = 0;
    {
        System.out.println("I am the art instance initialization");
    }
    Art() { System.out.println("Art constructor"); }
}
class Drawing extends Art {
    Drawing() { System.out.println("Drawing constructor"); }
}
public class Cartoon extends Drawing {
    public Cartoon() { System.out.println("Cartoon constructor"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cartoon x = new Cartoon();
    }
} /* Output:
Art constructor
Drawing constructor
Cartoon constructor
*///:~
```
You can see that the construction happens from the base “outward,” so the base class is initialized before the derived-class constructors can access it.
### Constructors with arguments
You must explicitly write the calls to the base-class constructor using the super keyword when dealing with constructors with arguments.
### Delegation
This is midway between inheritance and composition, because you place a member object in the class you’re building (like composition), but at the same time you expose all the methods from the member object in your new class (like inheritance). For example, a spaceship needs a control module:
```java
class SpaceShipControls {
    void up(int velocity) {}
    void down(int velocity) {}
    void left(int velocity) {}
    void right(int velocity) {}
    void forward(int velocity) {}
    void back(int velocity) {}
    void turboBoost() {}
} ///:~

//: reusing/SpaceShipDelegation.java
public class SpaceShipDelegation {
    private String name;
    private SpaceShipControls controls =
            new SpaceShipControls();
    public SpaceShipDelegation(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    // Delegated methods:
    public void back(int velocity) {
        controls.back(velocity);
    }
    public void down(int velocity) {
        controls.down(velocity);
    }
    public void forward(int velocity) {
        controls.forward(velocity);
    }
    public void left(int velocity) {
        controls.left(velocity);
    }
    public void right(int velocity) {
        controls.right(velocity);
    }
    public void turboBoost() {
        controls.turboBoost();
    }
    public void up(int velocity) {
        controls.up(velocity);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpaceShipDelegation protector =
                new SpaceShipDelegation("NSEA Protector");
        protector.forward(100);
    }
} ///:~
```
### Name hiding
```java
//: reusing/Hide.java
// Overloading a base-class method name in a derived
// class does not hide the base-class versions.

class Homer {
    char doh(char c) {
        System.out.println("doh(char)");
        return 'd';
    }
    float doh(float f) {
        System.out.println("doh(float)");
        return 1.0f;
    }
}
class Milhouse {}
class Bart extends Homer {
    void doh(Milhouse m) {
        System.out.println("doh(Milhouse)");
    }
}
public class Hide {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bart b = new Bart();
        b.doh(1);
        b.doh('x');
        b.doh(1.0f);
        b.doh(new Milhouse());
    }
} /* Output:
doh(float)
doh(char)
doh(float)
doh(Milhouse)
*///:~
```
You can see that all the overloaded methods of `Homer` are available in `Bart`, even though `Bart` introduces a new overloaded method. However, you should use a different type of the argument in the new overloaded method.
### Upcasting
Upcasting is always safe because you’re going from a more specific type to a more general type. That is, the derived class is a superset of the base class. The only thing that can occur to the class interface during the upcast is that it can lose methods, not gain them. This is why the compiler allows upcasting without any explicit casts or other special notation.
```java
//: reusing/Wind.java
// Inheritance & upcasting.
class Instrument {
    public void play() {}
    static void tune(Instrument i) {
// ...
        i.play();
    }
}
// Wind objects are instruments
// because they have the same interface:
public class Wind extends Instrument {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Wind flute = new Wind();
        Instrument.tune(flute); // Upcasting
    }
} ///:~
```
### Blank finals
Java allows the creation of blank finals, which are fields that are declared as `final` but are not given an initialization value. In all cases, the blank final must be initialized before it is used, and the compiler ensures this.
```java
//: reusing/BlankFinal.java
// "Blank" final fields.
class Poppet {
    private int i;
    Poppet(int ii) { i = ii; }
}
public class BlankFinal {
    private static final int VALUE_TWO;
    private final int i = 0; // Initialized final
    private final int j; // Blank final
    private final Poppet p; // Blank final reference
    // Blank finals MUST be initialized in the constructor:
    static {
        VALUE_TWO = 23;
    }
    public BlankFinal() {
        j = 1; // Initialize blank final
        p = new Poppet(1); // Initialize blank final reference
    }
    public BlankFinal(int x) {
        j = x; // Initialize blank final
        p = new Poppet(x); // Initialize blank final reference
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new BlankFinal();
        new BlankFinal(47);
    }
} ///:~
```
1. Initialized in instance initialization.
2. Initialized in constructor.
3. `static final` must be initialized in static initialization. 
### `final` arguments
Java allows you to make arguments final by declaring them as such in the argument list. This means that inside the method you cannot change what the argument reference points to:
```java
//: reusing/FinalArguments.java
// Using "final" with method arguments.
class Gizmo {
    public void spin() {}
}
public class FinalArguments {
    void with(final Gizmo g) {
//! g = new Gizmo(); // Illegal -- g is final
    }
    void without(Gizmo g) {
        g = new Gizmo(); // OK -- g not final
        g.spin();
    }
    // void f(final int i) { i++; } // Can’t change
// You can only read from a final primitive:
    int g(final int i) { return i + 1; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalArguments bf = new FinalArguments();
        bf.without(null);
        bf.with(null);
    }
} ///:~
```
### `final` and `private` methods
Final methods cannot be overridden. Private methods are not interface of the base-class so you just create new methods in the derived class if you want to "override" the private methods.
### `final` classes
No class can inherit from final classes. All methods in a final class are implicitly final since there is no way to override them.
```java
//: reusing/Jurassic.java
// Making an entire class final.
class SmallBrain {}
final class Dinosaur {
    int i = 7;
    int j = 1;
    SmallBrain x = new SmallBrain();
    void f() {}
}
//! class Further extends Dinosaur {}
// error: Cannot extend final class ‘Dinosaur’
public class Jurassic {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dinosaur n = new Dinosaur();
        n.f();
        n.i = 40;
        n.j++;
    }
} ///:~
```
### Initialization with inheritance
Remember that the compiled code for each class exists in its own separate file. That file isn’t loaded until the code is needed. In general, you can say that “class code is loaded at the point of first use.” This is usually when the first object of that class is constructed, but loading also occurs when a static field or static method is accessed.
```java
class Insect {
    private int i = 9;
    protected int j;
    Insect() {
        System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
        j = 39;
    }
    private static int x1 =
            printInit("static Insect.x1 initialized");
    static int printInit(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
        return 47;
    }
}
public class Beetle extends Insect {
    private int k = printInit("Beetle.k initialized");
    public Beetle() {
        System.out.println("k = " + k);
        System.out.println("j = " + j);
    }
    private static int x2 =
            printInit("static Beetle.x2 initialized");
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Beetle constructor");
        Beetle b = new Beetle();
    }
} /* Output:
static Insect.x1 initialized
static Beetle.x2 initialized
Beetle constructor
i = 9, j = 0
Beetle.k initialized
k = 47
j = 39
*///:~
```
The order: base-class static field -> derived-class static field -> (Object created) -> base-class instance & constructors-> derived-class instance & constructors.
